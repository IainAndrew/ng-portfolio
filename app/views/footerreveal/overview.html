					The footer reveal effect is one I come across quite often in modern web design. * I think it looks great *, and so I decided to write a jQuery plugin for people to quickly add this functionality to their footer element. I felt that it could be useful for beginners, or for people who simply want a fast way of implementing the effect on a fluid-height footer (not really achievable in pure CSS).
